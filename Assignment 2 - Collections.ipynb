    "**Collections**\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, particularly with data analysis, it is often either necessary or just ***really, really useful*** for us to work with collections of \"things\" instead of single, scalar values. You are probably familiar with this concept from your introductions to Matlab, which uses specific types of collections called arrays and matrices. Python includes support for both arrays and matrices in addition to many other types of collections. As with scalars, each type of collection has unique properties that determine how we interact with them at the Python console and the applications they can or should be used for. The main types of collections that we will use in this course are **tuples**, **arrays**, and **lists**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuple:** A tuple is set of \"items\" that are ordered and arranged by index. A tuple can include scalars (e.g., a tuple of strings), but it isn't limited to scalar contents.  That is, a tuple may contain other collections (e.g., a tuple of lists or a tuple of tuples). Just like strings, tuples are **immutable**. Again, this means that we **cannot** change the contents of a tuple once it is defined. If you need to replace an element in that tuple, you have to redefine the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you construct a tuple using parentheses.  **For example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "creates a tuple called A that contains four integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    B = ('apples', 'oranges', 'bananas') \n",
    "    \n",
    "creates a tuple called B that contains 3 different strings, and\n",
    "\n",
    "    C = (A, B)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Creates a tuple that includes two other tuples, A and B.  The first contains integers, and the second contains strings.  You are not constrained to a single type of scalar or even size of scalar inside of a tuple (A has 4 elements, while B has 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Give these a try in the cell below. Use print() to display the tuples, and use type() to check that all are tuples."

    "**Arrays**: Unlike Tuples, Arrays are **mutable**, ordered collections in which each element has a specific index. They can include any type of scalar or collection, so they are superficially similar to lists (which are covered below), but they have some important differences. One of the major ones, in simple terms is that you can *generally* perform mathematical operations directly on an array, whereas you cannot *generally* perform mathematical operations directly on a list. For the numerical simulations we will cover later in the course, arrays are very useful, so it is worth introducing them now. If you are familiar with Matlab, the \"array\" class in Python behaves similarly to the vectors and matrices that you're used to working with in Matlab (whereas lists do not). \n",

    "In Python, the most robust array support is provided by the **numpy** package, so this is a good place to introduce an aspect of Python that we haven't seen before. In languages like Matlab or Octave, more often than not, we are able to use features that are built into the language, whereas in Python, when we need to do something specific, we frequently have to add functionality that is missing from base Python. We do this by adding packages. \n",

This is because specific scripts need to utilize different tools that are not included in the Python base.\n",

    "I don't like to drop mysterious, complicated-looking commands on you without telling you what they do and how they work, but this was the cleanest way I could think of to get a single string to print out in the way I wanted. I figured it might be nice to get a look at some of the potential of the language, even if it isn't immediately obvious how you would come up with that.  Now let's pop the hood and see how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably notice there is a list comprehension in here.  It is performing an operation on each element in the list called **numbers**, but the str() method is a new one.  It is a built in tool that converts a generic scalar into a string.  Here, I am using it to change the integers in numbers into strings; the hyphen in numbers is already a string, so it isn't affected. Next, you see a **;**.  This allows you to separate two commands and write them on a single line.  So, at a Python Console, the first command would be exectued, defining a new list called **digits**.  Then, we move to the right hand side of the **;**. Here, you see print(), which you are familiar with, but what I am asking it to print, **''.join(digits)** is new. The **join()** method takes all individual elements in a string and concatenates them into a single, new string while putting any desired spacer between each element. The spacing is specified in between the **''** just before the period in .join(digits). Here, I did not want to insert spaces, so I declared that by stating **''** (with no space between them) before join. Don't worry if you don't understand it fully right now - it is an example to show you some of the versatility of the language! It is only assignment 2, and we are already able to think about some of the amazing ways that we can use list comprehensions and base Python features."
