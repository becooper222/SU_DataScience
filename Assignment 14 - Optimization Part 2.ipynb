Instead, I have to create function that accepts a *vector* input as its first argument.

Second, I can see that, initially, increasing the substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction, but this only occurs up to a certain point. This is referred to as \"saturation kinetics\" wherein the rate eventually becomes insensitive to additional increases in substrate concentration. This data set looks typical of a Michaelis-Menten mechanism for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, where the rate is usually described by:\n",

In this limit, $C_S$ is the dominant term in the denominator, and the rate approaches $V_{max}$, which should give you a hint as to why this parameter is called \"$V_{max}$\".\n",

But how do we do that? Looking at the graph, we can see that we have 13 different rate vs. $C_S$ pairs, all of which are noisy and subject to measurement uncertainty.  We didn't do anything wrong *per se*, this is just typical of a laboratory experiment, where there are many sources of error. Our first instinct might be to pick two rate vs. $C_S$ pairs and plug them into the Michaelis-Menten rate equation (I know because 70% of my CEN 587 students do this on their exams). That would give us two equations and two unknowns ($V_{max}$ and $K_m$), which we could easily solve using a root finding algorithm. Unfortunately, since none of our measurments are *exactly correct*, we will get different answers for every ($C_S$, rate) pair that we pick. Our system is over-determined, and it is incorrect (and honestly a bit lazy) to try to solve it as a system of equations. Instead, we have to solve it by *minimizing* the error between our measurements and our experiments. Usually, we do this by minimizing some form of the residual sum of squares, which quantifies the level of agreement between measurement values and model predictions. The most basic version is defined based only on the difference between the model and measurement:\n",

Minimizing that objective function by varying model parameters minimizes the residual sum of squares, which is the process of least squares regression. We use this method all the time! Every time you use a trendline in Excel, for example, you are performing a least squares regression (whether you knew it or not).  \n",

Though it isn't necessary to do so, I often rename them once inside the function scope to make it more readable.  Since I want that function to compute the error between model and measurement, I also need to access my experimental data inside of the function.
