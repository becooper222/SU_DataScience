    "## While Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "We just completed an exercise about **for loops**, so we should have a good feel for how they work. The main feature of a for loop is that it will iterate over all of the elements in a pre-defined set or range. A **while loop** is fundamentally different from a for loop in that it continues to loop through iterations as long as the criteria specified in the conditional statement at the start of the while loop remains true. This opens up some new possibilities in how we use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to some while loop-specific action, a good way to highlight the difference between a for loop and a while loop is to use them to do the exact same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a for loop to print all of the integers from 1 to 11 (without first creating that list of integers manually).  We will not store those integers in a list, we will just print their values to indicate passes through the for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(1,12):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the same with a while loop. We will initiate the while loop by defining n as the first integer we are interested in printing (1) and then increment the value of n until I reach an integer value of 11: \n",
    "\n",
    "    n = 1\n",
    "    while n < 12:\n",
    "        print(n)\n",
    "        n = n + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a for loop, a while loop starts with a keyword, **while** in this case. After the keyword, we have to specify what criteria we want to use to make a decision about the range that we iterate over.  In this case, I want to continue iterations until I reach the integer 11. While statements are a type of conditional statement; they tell the program to execute the commands inside of the loop as long as certain criteria are met. In general, we set these criteria using statements involving comparison operators: greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (==), greater than or equal to (>=), less than or equal to (<=), and not equal to (!=). Optionally, they may be combined with logical operators (and, or, not) if we need to satisfy multiple criteria to continue executing the while loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I've chosen to run iterations as long as n < 12. After the condition(s) for the while loop to continue is defined, we terminate the first line with a colon, just as we would with a function or a for loop. Subsequent lines are then indented to indicate that they are inside of the while loop. Once you return to flush left, the code is outside of the while loop and will not be exectued until the while loop is completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we initialize the loop by defining n = 1. At the start, n = 1, so when the interpreter hits the comparison in the while statement, it finds that the criteria that n < 12 is true. It then continues into the while loop and executes the commands in the body of the loop. The value of n (1) is printed to the screen, and then we add 1 to the value of n and return to the start of the loop. Now n = 2, which is still less than 12, so things continue and repeat in the same way until it gets to n = 11.  Since 11 < 12, it makes another pass through the loop, prints 11 to the screen, and then updates the value of n one last time.  Here, it calculates that n = 12, so n < 12 is no longer satisfied, and the loop does not proceed through the next iteration. \n",

    "Now, some useful Python shorthand. **For loops** always iterate automatically over the range we specify at the start, so we don't control the value of the iterator once we have defined the set to iterate over. With a **while loop**, we frequently update the value the quantity used to establish the while loop criteria on each pass. In the above example, we wanted to add 1 to our counter on every pass, and I include that in the loop by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    n = n + 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "It looks strange to define n as an implicit function of itself, but in a programming language, this syntax evaluates the right hand side using the current value of n, and then it over-writes the current value of n with whatever the right hand side evaluates to. For example, in our first pass through the above loop, n = 1. Then we hit the increment step, and we say n = n + 1, which is evaluated as n = 1 + 1, so n is redefined as 2 at the end of the first pass. At the end of the second pass, when we hit the increment, the current state is n = 2, so we evaluate n = 2 + 1, and n is redefined as 3.  This continues until our counter reaches whatever threshold we specify.\n",

For example, if I measured 100 discrete data points, and I wanted to perform operations on all of them, then a for loop makes sense because I'm working with an existing set. Generally, for creating a simple list in a range, I would probably always use a list comprehension instead of an expanded for or while loop because it is cleaner and easier to write.

That is much easier to deal with since I already know the answer.  If I add 3, 6, and 9, I get 18.  If I add 12 to that, I get 30.  So the set of multiples of 3 whose sum is less than 20 is clearly 3, 6, 9, and their sum is 18.  Let's solve *that* problem instead by adapting the above while loop.

This is our tolerance on the solution. Since we are using a very crude approach, we will set a loose tolerance and say that we will be satified if we can find the value of x where y is between -0.1 and 0.1. A simple way to do this is with the abs() function in python, which returns the absolute value of a number.  We can set this tolerance by saying we want to continue looking for the solution as long as abs(y) > 0.1. For our purposes, we'll call that \"close enough\" to zero that we've found a solution.

    "As engineers, we are frequently interested in processes that are operating at steady state.  This means that conditions for that process - temperatures, concentrations, pressures, etc. - are not changing as a function of time. But it is unusual for a process to *start* at steady state.  Let's look at how long it takes for your body to reach steady state on a run!  \n",

    "**Example 2: Steady state suffering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you go out for a run.  You start out at what you feel is a decent running pace. For the first few minutes, you feel pretty good. Your heart rate is low, your breathing rate is low, you aren't really perspiring very much...and that all lasts for awhile. Then everything starts to catch up to your effort.  Your pulse increases, you are breathing more rapidly, you are beginning to perspire.  You can hang in there, you just feel like you're working now. You keep your pace/effort steady. Now, you're 20 minutes in. You're flushed, you're gasping for breath, and you are certain that death is just around the corner. You somehow keep going...keeping both your pace and your level of suffering right about constant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you've arrived at what it feels like to run at that pace - *that is steady state*. Your work output, breathing, and metabolism are all in balance and nothing is changing as a function of time (as long as you keep your effort steady). Surely you've seen this - it takes some time for the level of pain to catch up to your level of effort, but eventually everything settles in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you make a perturbation to a system (in this case, the perturbation is you getting off the couch and starting to run), it takes time for the system to reach steady state. One way that we watch the approach to steady state is to monitor a variable that responds to perturbation as a function of time. In the running example, we could look at your heart rate, blood lactate concentration, or respiration rate.  Eventually, they will reach steady state, and we can roughly figure out how long it took to get there.  Next week, when we start on analyzing real data sets, I'll try to supply a power/heart rate data set vs. time for a bike race so that you all can process a big data set with pandas, but for now, let's just look at that approach to steady state in blood lactate levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume your blood lactate obeys the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lactate = Lactate_SS + (Lactate_0 - Lactate_SS)*exp(-k*t)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Lactate is your blood lactate concentration in millimoles per liter (mM) at a given time since you started running. Lactate_SS is the steady state blood lactate concentration at your current, near-death exertion level when running at a steady pace, and Lacate_0 is your blood lactate concentration at your more comfortable, sitting on the couch level when you started this run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say for simplicity Lactate_0 = 0.75 mM, Lactate_SS = 12 mM, and k is a time constant that specifies the time scales over which your blood lactate concentration responds to your change in effort from couch to 10K.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a while loop to determine how long it takes for you to reach peak, steady state suffering.  How will I determine when I'm at steady state?  I will set an absolute error tolerance of 0.01. Once I get within 0.01 mM of my known steady state lactate concentration(12 mM), I will say that I have reached steady state. This bit of code then prints out the time needed to hit steady state and also plots blood lactate as a function of time. It works by initializing time, tolerance, and your lactate level, and then it updates all of them on each pass of the loop.  Here, we increment time by a single minute with every step; you may need to adjust that step size depending on the time scale of your process.  You may question why I picked a starting tolerance of 100.  I can pick anything as long as it is larger than my threshold tolerance.  I just need something bigger than 0.01 so that I can start the loop. **Another quick reminder:**  exp is not in base Python; you can import it from the math package.\n",

It is just an example to show you how while loops work and how you might think to adapt the convergence criteria. It doesn't always need to take the form integer < number.  You can get pretty creative with these things."

    "OK, now for some serious fireworks. Let's combine for loops, while loops, and the dice roller function that we built in Assignment \\#3 to answer a really important question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:  How much damage will a magic battle axe do against a Lich anyway?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll travel to the legit game world, where your guild is up against something super gnarly. Let's say a very old Lich. Ok, let's just say you're fighting Acererak from Tomb of Horrors. Straight up bad news. \n",
    "\n",
    "After a pitched battle, everyone in your guild is down *except for you*. You aren't in great shape, but as far as you can tell, neither is Acererak. He looks rough *even by lich standards*, and you are pretty sure that he's on his last legs. Some back of the envelope estimation (out of game) suggests that Acererak has about 28 hit points remaining, give or take. You have a magic great axe that has *Lichslayer III* written in Dwarven on the handle. Acererak's physical armor is falling apart, and you swear you saw his mage armor flicker out of existence like 3 rounds ago. You're a 19th level berserker, so you have a great chance to hit...the question is whether it will do enough damage to put Acererak down. It is all down to this roll - you're up in initiative, and if you can beat 28, he's done for...but if you don't and he gets to return fire...he can hit you at will and pretty much take you down with a cantrip. It's...risky. Discretion may be the better part of valor? Do you drag your comrades along and head for the sunlight, or do you swing the axe?  Boy, it'd be nice to know what to expect on that damage roll.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to see if we can gauge our chances a bit by figuring out an average damage roll for *Lichslayer III*.  We'll assume you'll hit because you're a 19th level berserker and he basically has no armor left. Your great axe does 4d12+5 base damage and then 2d4+2 bonus damage against Liches (because, *Lichslayer III*). The way this works is you roll your dice sets individually, add any modifiers, and then sum everything up to calculate your total damage roll.  For example, 4d12+5, if we rolled a 12 on each of our 4 dice, would give a total base damage of 53. 2d4+2, if we rolled 4 on each of our dice, would give bonus damage of 10. Add those together, that's 63 and plenty to drop Acererak. But then, it's pretty rare to ace on all of those dice, and there is a good chance your roll comes out much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just for kicks, let's use a while loop to figure out the average result of that damage roll. This is basically the core of a monte carlo simulation - as a computer experiment, we will roll the dice (4d12+5 and 2d4+2) virtually and calculate the damage total. But we are actually interested in calculating the mean value by repeating the damage roll a number of times and then calculating the mean damage from all of our rolls. The thing we have to realize is that we will not approach the true mean until we repeat the damage roll many, many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this doesn't quite make sense, imagine flipping a quarter 4 times...there is a good chance you don't get heads twice and tails twice, even though the probability of either roll is 1/2. If you flip the coin 100,000 times though, you will approach 50,000 heads and 50,000 tails, which is what you'd expect based on probability of the two outcomes. So the question I want to answer is how many times we need to make that damage roll before we get a reasonable approximation for the average of 4d12+5 + 2d4+2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fun example, but we really are just running a simulation until it coverges, and similar techniques are at the core of various simulations you might use in research, statistics, or data analysis. We are just going to use a while loop to continue increasing the number of damage rolls we make until the mean we get is no longer changing relative to our best current estimate of the mean. At that point, our simulation has converged, and we will consider this a pretty good approximation for our mean damage roll. \n",
    "\n",
    "As above, we have to set a convergence threshold.  I'll say that I'm happy if the specific experiment I've just run (making the damage roll \"n\" times and taking the average result) returns a mean value that is within 0.001 units of the average of *every single damage roll* I have made up to that point. When I hit a value of \"n\" damage rolls that satisfies this threshold, we are reaching a spot where adding another dice roll to the simulation does not significantly change the average result, so we stop increasing the number of times we make the damage roll, and we say this is a reasonable approximation of the average result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've constructed this as a for loop nested within a while loop.  The while loop continues iterating until we meet our convergence criteria, and the for loop calculates the mean damage roll for \"n\" damage rolls. Our first experiment is going to be rolling our damage total 4 times (n = 4). Once the for loop is done, we figure out the \"average\" of those 4 damage rolls, and we append it to our running tally of average results for \"n\" damage rolls. We then increment and go to 5 damage rolls and repeat the process for n = 5, then n = 6, and so forth. We will proceed until the average of \"n\" damage rolls is roughly equal to the average of **all** of the damage rolls I've made prior to those \"n\" rolls (taking the average of 1 roll, 2 rolls, 3 rolls, etc). To set up this simulation, I seeded the results of 1, 2, and 3 dice rolls with a few values - the minimum possible result (13), the maximum possible result (63), and something about in the middle (40). I did this to make sure I start out my 4 roll simulation in a spot where I am not immediately meeting my threshold criteria so that the simulation can proceed. As n gets large, the value of these first 3 made up results become insignificant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start - this is a great test case for a monte-carlo type method because we know the result or can figure it out easily based on probability.  Without going into too many details, the mean result for a d12 is 6.5, and the mean result for a d4 is 2.5. Based on that (4\\*6.5) + 5 + (2\\*2.5) + 2 = 38\n",
    "\n",
    "If we've done our simulation correctly, we expect that our mean result will converge on 38.  Again, I am pointing this out because a computer will give you an output even if you've made mistakes in your code.  Anytime you can, test out your method on a system that you know the answer to - get it working there, and then scale it up to the system that you don't know the answer to already.\n",
