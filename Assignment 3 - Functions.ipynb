    "**Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are some of the most useful classes of objects in any high level programming language, and Python is no exception!  In very basic terms, a function accepts inputs, performs operations on them, and returns outputs.  The classic idea we all have of a function is something like y is a function of x for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "y(x) = 2*x + 5\n",
    "\n",
    "But we will see in a moment that functions are far more general and flexible. In Python, we follow a few important rules to define a function. To start, you declare a function with the **def** keyword, and you always use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def function_name(inputs):\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \"function_name\" can be anything you want it to be, and \"inputs\" can be zero, one, or more inputs that you will provide to the function in order for it to perform its operations. Of the parts you see here, the only things that are non negotiable in a function definition are \"def\" and \":\" \n",
    "\n",
    "**The next bit is important:** Every line after the first one in the function (the one with def and : in it), all the way up to the end of your function, *must be indented from the left margin*. If a line is indented beyond the def keyword, that means that line is inside of the function definition.  Once you return to the left margin, you are no longer writing code inside of that function. Python uses indentation instead of something like an **end** keyword that you see in many languages. In Python, indentation is what distinguishes a bit of code from being inside of a function (or loop) and being outside of that function (or loop). Typically a good editor will auto-indent the next line for you once it sees a : at the end of a line.  Jupyter, for example, does this by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, our simple linear function would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def y(x):\n",
    "        result = 2*x + 5\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get used to thinking through how a piece of code will work - you really cannot learn to program until you understand how code is executed, so this is good practice. In this example, any time I want to evaluate the answer for y(x), I give a value of x to the function, i.e., I provide the necessary **input** to my function. The function then computes the \"result\" for that value of the input using whatever operations I specify, and then it **returns** that result as its **output**. I can set that result equal to a variable, I can print it to the screen, and I can use it for all manner of operations once I've run the function. This is a fairly easy function to evaluate, and I can see that for x = 10, this function should give me the result that y = 25.  Let's try it in the cell below.  Starting flush at the left margin (The **def** keyword should not be indented in the Python cell for this example), type the function definition exactly as it appears above, including indentation, and then return flush to the left margin and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(y(10))\n",
    "    \n",
    "Confirm that you get the result of 25 before moving on."

But I want everyone to learn to think more abstractly about what functions are and what they can do, so we need to break the habit of always thinking that by \"function\" we mean \"polynomial\" as in the y(x) example above.  \n",
    "\n",
